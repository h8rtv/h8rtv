I'm a software developer, currently focusing in Machine Learning stuff, but always interested in the Web world.

I publish my personal projects and my university projects here.

Fun fact: my profile picture is a "french bread", which is one of the most common bread consumed in Brazil. The origin of that name probably traces back to the 20th century, when brazillian newly-formed republic where heavily influenced by the 'Belle Ã‰poque' period, and developed a deep appreciation for the legendary baguette ðŸ¥–. Eager to bring this culinary delight to Brazil, the task of replicating the baguette ðŸ¥– was entrusted to local bakers. Through their efforts, the brazilian "french bread" emerged, but it ended up being short somehow.
